        <h3>Irena Sendler</h3>
        <p>Irena Sendler was a Polish nurse and social worker who served in the Polish Underground in German-occupied Warsaw during World War II, and was head of the children's section of Zegota, the Polish Council to Aid Jews (Polish: Rada Pomocy Å»ydom), which was active from 1942 to 1945.
        Assisted by some two dozen other Zegota members, Sendler smuggled approximately 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then provided them with false identity documents and shelter outside the Ghetto, saving those children from the Holocaust. With the exception of diplomats who issued visas to help Jews flee Nazi-occupied Europe, Sendler saved more Jews than any other individual during the Holocaust.  The German occupiers eventually discovered her activities and she was arrested by the Gestapo, tortured, and sentenced to death, but she managed to evade execution and survive the war. In 1965, Sendler was recognised by the State of Israel as Righteous among the Nations. Late in life she was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland's highest honor, for her wartime humanitarian efforts. She was a candidate for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize but lost out to Al Gore! wtf
        Irena and her comrades smuggled children out of the Warsaw Ghetto by hidding them in suitcases and bags, ambulences and vans, after being given permission to enter the Ghetto to check for signs of infectious desiese. She was enventually caught by German soldiers and tortured, but never gave away any information. She died in 2008.
